# Lightsail Domain Connection Troubleshooting (2025-03-25 15:03:42)

_**User**_

I'm trying to connect my domain via lightsail, I've done everything but I'm seeing the following error. 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you with your domain connection issue in Lightsail. I'll examine the error shown in your terminal.

Looking at your terminal screenshot, I can see the issue. Your server is failing to connect to the IP address 13.42.190.45 on port 80, and there appears to be a server configuration problem.

The error shows:
```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 13.42.190.45 port 80 after 1 ms: Couldn't connect to server
```

This is happening after you tried to restart Apache with `sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart` and then attempted to curl your domain.

The terminal also shows that your Node.js application is trying to run on a port defined by `PORT` environment variable or defaulting to 3000:
```
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

Based on the Apache configuration visible at the top of your screenshot, you're trying to set up a proxy from Apache to a local service running on port 5501, but the connection isn't working.

To fix this issue, you should:

1. Verify the service is actually running on port 5501 (the one configured in your Apache proxy)
2. Check your Lightsail instance's firewall settings to ensure port 80 is open
3. Verify the IP address 13.42.190.45 is correct and reachable

Would you like me to suggest specific commands to troubleshoot these issues?

---

_**User**_

yes, let's go through each step

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's troubleshoot each step systematically:

### 1. Verify the service is running on port 5501

---

Cancelled

---

_**User**_

I'm using the lightsil SSH 

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand you're accessing this through Lightsail SSH. Let's adapt our troubleshooting approach specifically for your Lightsail environment:

### 1. Verify the service is running on port 5501

---

```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 5501
```

```
hafsayuusuf@Hafsas-MacBook-Air HABS COLLECTION final % sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 5501                     s
udo netstat -tulpn | grep 5501
Password:
```

---

I see we're having permission issues with the commands. Since you're in a Lightsail SSH session but the commands are executing on your local machine, let's try a different approach.

From what I can see in your screenshot, you need to:

### 1. Check if your application is running

---

Cancelled

---

_**User**_

its fine, I am on the browser just provide me the code 

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are the commands you should run in your Lightsail SSH terminal to troubleshoot the connection issues:

### 1. Check if any service is running on port 5501
```
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 5501
```
or
```
sudo lsof -i :5501
```

### 2. Check if your Node.js application is running
```
ps aux | grep node
```

### 3. Start your Node.js application if it's not running
Navigate to your application directory and run:
```
cd /opt/habs-collections
node scripts/server.js
```
If you're using npm:
```
cd /opt/habs-collections
npm start
```

### 4. Check Apache configuration
```
cat /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf
```
or any virtual host configurations:
```
cat /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/*.conf
```

### 5. Check Apache error logs
```
tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

### 6. Verify Apache is running
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl status
```

### 7. Test local connectivity to your application
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:5501/
```

### 8. Check if your domain is correctly pointing to your Lightsail instance
```
dig +short yourdomain.com
```
Compare this with your Lightsail instance's public IP.

Make sure port 5501 is the correct port where your application is running. If your application is running on a different port (like 3000 as shown in your code), you'll need to update your Apache proxy configuration to match.

---

_**User**_

I've done the following so far, please guide me through the steps

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue more clearly now. Based on the terminal output, you're facing two key problems:

1. The Node.js server is failing to start with an "EADDRINUSE" error - port 3000 is already in use
2. There's a path discrepancy - your commands suggest `/opt/habs-collections` but the error shows it can't find that directory

Here's how to fix these issues:

### 1. First, fix the path issue
The error shows: `-bash: cd: /opt/habs-collections: No such file or directory`

The correct path appears to be `/opt/habs-collection` (without the 's' at the end). Try:

```
cd /opt/habs-collection
```

### 2. Kill the process using port 3000
```
sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:3000)
```

### 3. Restart your Node.js application
```
cd /opt/habs-collection
node scripts/server.js
```

### 4. Update the Apache proxy configuration
The terminal history shows you're using port 5501 in your Apache configuration, but your Node.js app is trying to use port 3000. You need to either:

- Change your Node.js app to use port 5501:
  ```
  cd /opt/habs-collection
  nano scripts/server.js
  ```
  Then change the PORT line to:
  ```
  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5501;
  ```

OR

- Update your Apache proxy configuration to point to port 3000 instead of 5501:
  ```
  sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/yoursite.conf
  ```
  Change:
  ```
  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
  ```
  To:
  ```
  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
  ```

### 5. Restart Apache after making changes
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

### 6. Test the connection
```
curl http://localhost:3000
```

These steps should resolve both the path issue and the port conflict that's preventing your application from starting.

---

_**User**_

I can't see the port option to change 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see you're viewing the server.js file. Let's scroll down to find the port configuration which should be near the bottom of the file. You need to modify the line where the app.listen method is called.

Based on the error you showed previously, we know the port is set to 3000 in your code, but we need to find the exact line to change it.

Use one of these commands to find the app.listen line that defines the port:

```
nano scripts/server.js
```

Then press Ctrl+W and search for "app.listen" or "PORT".

Or you can use:

```
grep -n "app.listen" scripts/server.js
```

From the previous screenshots, I saw this line:
```
371:const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
372:app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

You need to change line 371 from:
```
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```
to:
```
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5501;
```

Since you're already in the nano editor, navigate to line 371 (press Ctrl+_ and type 371), then change 3000 to 5501. Save the file with Ctrl+O, then Enter, then exit with Ctrl+X.

After saving, restart your Node.js server:
```
node scripts/server.js
```

---

_**User**_

okay that is done 

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Now that you've changed the port from 3000 to 5501, let's proceed with the next steps:

1. Start your Node.js application:
```
node scripts/server.js
```

2. Verify your server is running on port 5501:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```

3. Restart Apache to ensure it picks up any configuration changes:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

4. Test your domain connection by visiting your domain in a browser or using curl:
```
curl http://yourdomain.com
```

5. If you're still having issues, check your Apache configuration to ensure it's correctly proxying to port 5501:
```
cat /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/yoursite.conf
```

Verify these lines in the configuration:
```
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
```

6. Check Apache error logs if you're still having issues:
```
tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

Let me know the results after these steps, and we can troubleshoot further if needed.

---

_**User**_

I'm stuck here 

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see your Node.js server is running successfully on port 5501 and you've verified it with curl. Great progress!

Now let's check and fix your Apache configuration to properly proxy to your Node.js application:

1. First, check your current Apache virtual host configuration:
```
cat /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/*
```
or
```
grep -r "ProxyPass" /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/
```

2. Make sure your virtual host configuration includes these lines (and they match exactly):
```
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
```

3. If you need to modify the configuration, edit it with:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/yoursite.conf
```
Replace "yoursite.conf" with your actual configuration file name.

4. After making changes, restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

5. Check that Apache is running:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl status
```

6. Make sure port 80 is open in your Lightsail firewall:
```
sudo iptables -L -n | grep 80
```

7. Test external connectivity:
```
curl http://your-public-ip
```
Replace "your-public-ip" with your Lightsail instance's public IP address.

8. Check the Apache error logs for any issues:
```
tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

These steps should help diagnose why your domain isn't connecting properly even though your Node.js application is running correctly on port 5501.

---

_**User**_

I'm not running the code in the right place 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue now. Based on your terminal path, you're running the Node.js server in `/opt/habs-collections`, but your server file mentions paths like `../public` and `../models`.

Let's fix this by running the server from the correct directory structure:

1. First, stop your current Node.js server by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

2. Navigate to the correct parent directory:
```
cd /opt/habs-collection
```
or
```
cd /opt
```
Then check what directories exist:
```
ls -la
```

3. Once you find the correct directory (which should contain your server.js file in a scripts subfolder), navigate to it:
```
cd /correct/parent/directory
```

4. Start your server from the right location:
```
node scripts/server.js
```

If you're not sure about your project's directory structure, you can use:
```
find /opt -name "server.js" -type f
```
This will show you all server.js files under /opt so you can determine the correct path.

Running your Node.js application from the correct directory is crucial because relative paths in your code (like `../public`) need to resolve properly.

_**User**_

I need to open bitnami

---

_**Assistant**_

To access the Bitnami configuration and tools, you'll need to:

1. Check the Bitnami installation directory:
```
ls -la /opt/bitnami
```

2. Access Bitnami configuration files:
```
cd /opt/bitnami
```

3. Check the Apache configuration:
```
ls -la /opt/bitnami/apache/conf
```

4. View virtual hosts configuration:
```
ls -la /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts
```

5. Edit a specific virtual host configuration:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/yourconfig.conf
```

6. For Bitnami Apache control:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl status
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl stop
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl start
```

7. To access Bitnami logs:
```
cd /opt/bitnami/apache/logs
tail -100 error_log
tail -100 access_log
```

8. To access Bitnami utilities:
```
ls -la /opt/bitnami/common/bin
```

9. To check which ports Bitnami services are using:
```
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep bitnami
```

10. To find where a specific Bitnami configuration file is located:
```
find /opt/bitnami -name "httpd.conf"
```

These commands should help you access and manage your Bitnami installation on your Lightsail instance.

---

_**User**_

Wait, please inspcect the screenshot and check where I am, how do I do the next steps from here

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on your screenshot, I can see you've already:

1. Successfully navigated to `/opt/habs-collection`
2. Started your Node.js server with `node scripts/server.js`
3. Confirmed it's running on port 5501
4. Connected to MongoDB

You're in the right place! Now you need to configure Apache to properly proxy requests to your Node.js application.

Here are the next steps:

1. First, check your domain's Apache configuration:
```
sudo find /opt/bitnami/apache/conf -name "*.conf" | xargs grep -l "ProxyPass"
```

2. Edit the virtual host configuration for your domain:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME.conf
```
(Replace YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME with your actual domain configuration file name)

3. Make sure your virtual host configuration includes:
```
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
```

4. Save the file (Ctrl+O, then Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X)

5. Restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

6. Check Apache status:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl status
```

7. Test your domain connection (from another terminal):
```
curl http://your-instance-ip
```

8. If you don't have a specific vhost file yet, you may need to create one. Check the default configuration:
```
sudo cat /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/bitnami/bitnami.conf
```

Keep your Node.js server running in the current terminal window. The output shows it's working properly on port 5501, and your next steps are configuring Apache to direct traffic to it.

---

_**User**_

No you don't understand, when it says connected to MongoDB it stops there, then I can't run any code

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand now - your Node.js server is running but you're stuck at the command prompt because the server is actively running in the foreground. This is normal behavior because your server process is occupying the terminal.

You have two options:

### Option 1: Open a new terminal session
Since your server is running in the current terminal, you need to open a new SSH session to your Lightsail instance to run additional commands. In the AWS Lightsail console:
1. Click on your instance
2. Click on "Connect" or "Connect using SSH" 
3. This will open a new terminal session where you can run the Apache configuration commands

### Option 2: Run the server in the background
1. Stop your current Node.js server with Ctrl+C
2. Then restart it in the background using:
```
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```
3. This will run the server in the background and save the output to server.log
4. To check if it's running:
```
ps aux | grep node
```

If you choose Option 2, you'll be able to run the Apache configuration commands in the same terminal window.

To proceed with your Apache configuration after getting a free terminal (either method), follow the steps from my previous message to configure the virtual host to proxy to your Node.js app on port 5501.

_**User**_

I did this, have I made a mistake

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your screenshot, everything appears to be running correctly. Your Node.js server is running on port 5501 and connected to MongoDB. This is exactly what you want.

When a Node.js server runs, it normally shows these messages and then continues running without returning to the command prompt. This is the expected behavior. The server is waiting for incoming requests, which is why it doesn't return to the command prompt.

You haven't made a mistake. Your server is running properly.

To check if everything is working correctly with your Apache configuration:

1. Open a new SSH session to your Lightsail instance (from the Lightsail console)
2. In the new terminal, run:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```
This should return the content from your server.

3. Check if Apache is properly configured:
```
curl -I http://localhost
```
This should show an HTTP 200 response if Apache is working.

4. Check Apache configuration:
```
sudo cat /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME.

---

_**User**_

I did this, have I made a mistake

---

_**Assistant**_

I see you're now in the nano editor for the virtual host configuration file at `/opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.com`. This is good!

Now you need to add the ProxyPass directives to this file. The file appears to be mostly empty with just a `<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:81>` and `ServerName status.localhost` line.

In this file, you should add the following configuration:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName habscollection.com
    ServerAlias www.habscollection.com
    
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
    
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Type this configuration into the nano editor, save it with Ctrl+O and then Enter, and exit with Ctrl+X.

After saving, restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

Everything looks good in your previous steps:
1. You've successfully started your Node.js server in the background with `node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &`
2. You verified it's running with `ps aux | grep node`
3. You confirmed localhost:5501 is working with `curl http://localhost:5501`

No, you haven't made any mistakes. You're following the correct process. The next step is just to complete the Apache virtual host configuration as I've shown above.

---

_**User**_

okay please guide me through it

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll guide you through completing the Apache virtual host configuration:

1. You're already in the nano editor for your configuration file. Add the following configuration (replacing any existing content):

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName habscollection.com
    ServerAlias www.habscollection.com
    
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
    
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

2. Save the file by pressing Ctrl+O, then press Enter to confirm the filename.

3. Exit the nano editor by pressing Ctrl+X.

4. Restart Apache to apply the changes:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

5. Check if Apache restarted successfully:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl status
```

6. Test if the configuration is working:
```
curl -I http://localhost
```
You should see an HTTP 200 response.

7. If everything looks good, verify that your domain is correctly pointing to your Lightsail instance's IP address:
```
dig +short habscollection.com
```
Compare this with your Lightsail instance's public IP:
```
curl -s http://checkip.amazonaws.com
```

8. If the IP addresses match, try accessing your domain in a web browser. It should now be proxying requests to your Node.js application.

9. If you encounter any issues, check the Apache error logs:
```
sudo tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

Let me know if you have any issues with any of these steps!

---

_**User**_

I already had this before 

---

_**Assistant**_

If you already had the ProxyPass configuration in your Apache virtual host file, let's check a few things to see why it's not working:

1. First, let's ensure the Apache modules for proxying are enabled:
```
ls -la /opt/bitnami/apache/modules | grep proxy
```
Look for files like `mod_proxy.so` and `mod_proxy_http.so`

2. Check if these modules are loaded in the Apache configuration:
```
grep -r "LoadModule.*proxy" /opt/bitnami/apache/conf
```

3. Check if there are any syntax errors in your Apache configuration:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -t
```

4. Let's look at your virtual host configuration again to ensure it's correct:
```
cat /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.com
```

5. Check to confirm Apache is actually listening on port 80:
```
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep apache
```

6. Check the Node.js application again to confirm it's still running:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```

7. Check Apache error logs for any clues:
```
sudo tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

8. If you're using Lightsail, make sure port 80 is allowed in the firewall settings. Check your Lightsail networking tab in the AWS console.

9. Try to restart Apache one more time:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

10. Check that your domain DNS settings are correctly pointing to your Lightsail instance's IP address.

Let's go through these steps to identify what might be causing the issue.

---

_**User**_

Let's just start again from scratch

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's start fresh with a step-by-step approach to connect your domain to your Node.js application running on Lightsail:

### Step 1: Make sure your Node.js app is running properly
```
cd /opt/habs-collection
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &
curl http://localhost:5501
```
If this returns your application's content, your Node.js app is running correctly on port 5501.

### Step 2: Configure Apache virtual host

1. Create/edit your virtual host configuration:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```

2. Add this configuration (replace with your domain):
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName habscollection.com
    ServerAlias www.habscollection.com
    
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
    
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

3. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

### Step 3: Make sure proxy modules are loaded
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/bitnami/bitnami.conf
```

Look for these lines (they should be uncommented, without a # at the beginning):
```
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
```

If they're commented (with a #), remove the # to enable them.

### Step 4: Check for syntax errors
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -t
```

### Step 5: Restart Apache
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

### Step 6: Verify Apache status
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl status
```

### Step 7: Test local connection
```
curl http://localhost
```

### Step 8: Check Apache error logs if there are issues
```
sudo tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

### Step 9: Verify DNS settings
Make sure your domain points to your Lightsail instance's IP address. In the AWS Lightsail console:
1. Go to your instance
2. Note the public IP address
3. Ensure your domain's DNS A record points to this IP

### Step 10: Check Lightsail firewall settings
In the AWS Lightsail console:
1. Go to your instance
2. Click on "Networking"
3. Ensure that port 80 (HTTP) is allowed

Let me know when you've completed each step and what the results are.

_**User**_

Please inspect this image, following step 1

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see you've successfully completed Step 1:

1. You navigated to `/opt/habs-collection`
2. Started your Node.js server with `node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &` (it's running with process ID 24693)
3. Tested it with `curl http://localhost:5501`
4. Got a successful response: `<html><body><h1>HABS Collection</h1><p>Site is up and running!</p></body></html>`

This confirms your Node.js application is running correctly on port 5501. That's perfect!

Now let's move to Step 2 - configuring the Apache virtual host:

```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```

Add the following configuration (replace with your actual domain):

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName habscollection.com
    ServerAlias www.habscollection.com
    
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
    
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

_**User**_

okay that is done

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Now let's continue with Step 3 - checking if proxy modules are loaded:

```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/bitnami/bitnami.conf
```

Look for these lines:
```
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
```

Make sure they're not commented out (no # at the start of the lines).

After checking that, let's move to Step 4 and 5:

Check for syntax errors:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -t
```

If no errors, restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

Then verify Apache status:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl status
```

Let me know what you see after running these commands, and we'll proceed with the next steps.

---

_**User**_

how do I look for the loadmodule lines, this is what I currently see 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see you're in the bitnami.conf file but it doesn't show the LoadModule lines in the visible portion. Let's press Ctrl+W (for search in nano) and search for "LoadModule proxy".

If you don't find it in this file, we need to check the main httpd.conf file:

```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf
```

And search for "LoadModule proxy" there.

Alternatively, we can directly check if the modules are loaded using:

```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -M | grep proxy
```

This will show all loaded modules with "proxy" in their name.

If the proxy modules aren't loaded, we'll need to add these lines to httpd.conf:

```
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
```

For now, let's continue with Step 4 - checking for syntax errors:

```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -t
```

If that passes without errors, continue with Step 5 - restart Apache:

```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

Then check Step 6 - test if your site is now working locally:

```
curl http://localhost
```

---

_**User**_

It doesn't look like I have it, how do I add the lines to httpd.conf

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's add the LoadModule lines to the httpd.conf file:

1. Open httpd.conf with nano:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf
```

2. Scroll down to where other LoadModule lines are (typically near the top of the file). You can press Ctrl+W and search for "LoadModule" to find the section.

3. Add these two lines after the other LoadModule lines:
```
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
```

4. Save the file with Ctrl+O, then press Enter to confirm.

5. Exit nano with Ctrl+X.

6. Check for any syntax errors:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -t
```

7. If no errors, restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

8. Verify the modules are loaded:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -M | grep proxy
```

9. Test if the proxy is now working:
```
curl http://localhost
```

If this returns the content from your Node.js app, the proxy configuration is working correctly!

---

_**User**_

I also received this error earlier when I tried to directly check if modules are loaded using - sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -M | grep proxy

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the error now. There are two issues:

1. The proxy modules might not be loaded
2. There's an issue with the APACHE_LOG_DIR variable not being defined, causing configuration check to fail

Let's fix these issues:

### 1. First, let's edit your virtual host configuration to fix the log directory issue:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```

Change:
```
ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
```

To:
```
ErrorLog /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
CustomLog /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/access_log combined
```

Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

### 2. Now, let's add the proxy modules to httpd.conf:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf
```

Scroll down to where other LoadModule lines are and add:
```
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
```

Save and exit.

### 3. Check if the module files actually exist:
```
ls -la /opt/bitnami/apache/modules/mod_proxy*
```

### 4. If the module files don't exist, you might need to install them:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-proxy-html
```

### 5. After fixing these issues, check the configuration syntax:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -t
```

### 6. If that passes, restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

### 7. Test your configuration:
```
curl http://localhost
```

Let me know if you encounter any errors after making these changes.

---

_**User**_

do I have the load module now or do I still need to add

---

_**Assistant**_

I see you're in the httpd.conf file, which shows many LoadModule lines but I don't see the proxy modules in the visible portion.

You need to add these two lines to the file in this section where the other LoadModule lines are:

```
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
```

Press the down arrow key to continue scrolling through the file to find the right place to add them. Add them after the other LoadModule lines, before any non-LoadModule lines.

After adding these lines:
1. Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter)
2. Exit nano (Ctrl+X)
3. Check the syntax:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -t
```
4. If the syntax check passes, restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

Let's also remember to fix the log directory issue in your virtual host configuration file:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```

Change the log paths as mentioned in my previous message.

---

_**User**_

I checked I already have both 

---

_**Assistant**_

If you already have both proxy modules loaded, let's focus on fixing the log directory issue in your virtual host configuration:

1. Edit your virtual host file:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```

2. Change:
```
ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
```

To use the actual paths:
```
ErrorLog /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
CustomLog /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/access_log combined
```

3. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

4. Check the syntax:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -t
```

5. If syntax check passes, restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

6. Test if Apache is proxying to your Node.js app:
```
curl http://localhost
```

7. Check for any error messages:
```
sudo tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

If you're still having issues, let's verify if the virtual host is being loaded:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -S
```
This will show all loaded virtual hosts.

---

_**User**_

I'm still having port 80 connection problems 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. Your configuration syntax is OK, but there's a connection problem. The error shows:

```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 80 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server
```

Let's check a few things:

1. First, make sure Apache is actually running after restart:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl status
```

2. Check if Apache is listening on port 80:
```
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :80
```

3. Check if port 80 is blocked by another process:
```
sudo lsof -i :80
```

4. If nothing is showing as using port 80, let's try to force Apache to listen on port 80 by editing the ports.conf file:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/ports.conf
```
Look for a "Listen" directive and make sure it includes:
```
Listen 80
```

5. Check if the Lightsail firewall is blocking port 80:
In the AWS Lightsail console, go to your instance, click on "Networking" tab, and ensure port 80 is allowed.

6. Try to explicitly set the VirtualHost to listen on port 80:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```
And make sure it starts with:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
```

7. Test if the port 5501 is directly accessible:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```

8. Check Apache error logs for any clues:
```
sudo tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

Let's address these issues one by one to determine why port 80 isn't responding.

---

_**User**_

I see this now when I checked if Apache was running

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue now. The error message shows:

```
/opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl: 95: lynx: not found
```

This indicates that Apache is not actually starting properly. The status command can't find lynx which is a text-based web browser used to display the status.

Let's focus on getting Apache to start:

1. Try starting Apache directly:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/httpd -k start
```

2. If that doesn't work, check what processes are using ports 80 and 443:
```
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep ":80\|:443"
```

3. Install lynx to help with status checking (not essential but helpful):
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lynx
```

4. Check Apache's main error log:
```
sudo tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

5. Let's also check if there are any global Bitnami services that need to be started:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh status
```

6. Try restarting all Bitnami services:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart
```

7. Check if the Apache server is included in Bitnami's control script:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh help
```

The main issue seems to be that Apache is not actually running. Let's focus on getting it started first, then we can worry about the proxy configuration.

---

_**User**_

I did this and got this:
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/httpd -k start
httpd (pid 22219) already running
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ 

---

_**Assistant**_

Interesting! This shows that Apache is actually running but the status command couldn't show it properly due to the missing lynx tool.

Let's proceed with troubleshooting the connection issue:

1. First, check if Apache is actually listening on port 80:
```
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :80
```

2. Check if your site is configured correctly in Apache:
```
sudo grep -r "ServerName" /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/
```

3. Let's make sure the VirtualHost directive is correct. Try editing your site's conf file:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```

Make sure it has:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName habscollection.com
    # rest of your configuration
</VirtualHost>
```

4. Let's test connectivity to both the Node.js app and Apache:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```
and
```
curl -v http://localhost
```
The -v flag will give more verbose output to see where the connection is failing.

5. Check the bitnami configuration for any default sites that might be interfering:
```
sudo ls -la /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/bitnami/
```

6. Ensure that your virtual host configuration is being included. Check if there's an Include directive in the main config:
```
sudo grep -r "Include.*vhosts" /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/
```

7. Try forcing your site to be the default by creating a symbolic link:
```
sudo ln -sf /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/bitnami.conf
```

8. Restart Apache again:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

Let me know the results of these commands so we can pinpoint the issue.

---

_**User**_

Wait guide me through it slowly, I see this after step 2

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue now. The results show that Apache is running, but there's a specific problem with port 80 connectivity. Let's analyze this step by step:

1. Apache is definitely running (pid 22219)
2. When you searched for ServerName, you found multiple configuration files
3. Your habscollection.conf is correctly configured with ServerName habscollection.com

The key issue appears to be that Apache isn't listening on port 80 properly, or something else is interfering.

Let's continue troubleshooting:

1. Check what's actually listening on port 80:
```
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :80
```
This will show if Apache or any other process is actively listening on port 80.

2. Try testing with verbose output to see where the connection fails:
```
curl -v http://localhost
```

3. Let's look at the Apache ports configuration:
```
sudo grep -r "Listen" /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/
```
This will show what ports Apache is configured to listen on.

4. Check the Bitnami script to see if there's a firewall or other component that might be blocking access:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh status
```

5. Check the Lightsail instance's networking configuration in the AWS console to verify port 80 is open.

6. Look for any errors in the Apache error log:
```
sudo tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

Let's focus on determining if Apache is actually listening on port 80 and what might be blocking connections to it.

_**User**_

I can see this:

bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ 

---

_**Assistant**_

This shows that nothing is actually listening on port 80, despite Apache supposedly running. Let's try to fix this:

1. First, let's check if Apache is actually configured to listen on port 80:
```
sudo grep -r "Listen" /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/
```

2. If the Listen 80 directive isn't found or is commented out, edit the ports.conf file:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/ports.conf
```
Add or uncomment:
```
Listen 80
```

3. If that doesn't exist, check the main configuration:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf
```
Look for a Listen directive and make sure it includes port 80.

4. Since we saw "Listen 81" in your earlier screenshots, Apache might be configured to listen on a different port. Try:
```
curl -v http://localhost:81
```

5. Let's check if Bitnami has a specific configuration:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh status all
```

6. Let's also see what ports Apache is actually listening on:
```
sudo lsof -i -P | grep apache
```
or
```
sudo lsof -i -P | grep httpd
```

7. Try restarting Apache with explicit port configuration:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/httpd -k restart -c "Listen 80"
```

8. If none of these work, try checking if the Apache ports are being forwarded or mapped in any way:
```
sudo iptables -t nat -L -n
```

Let's get Apache actually listening on port 80 first, then we can continue with the proxy configuration.

---

_**Assistant**_

I found the issue! Apache is configured to listen on port 81, not port 80. This is why you couldn't connect to it on port 80. 

You have two options:

### Option 1: Change Apache to listen on port 80
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf
```
Change `Listen 81` to `Listen 80`

### Option 2: Keep using port 81 but update your configuration

1. First, test if port 81 is working:
```
curl -v http://localhost:81
```

2. If that works, edit your VirtualHost configuration:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```
Change:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
```
To:
```
<VirtualHost *:81>
```

3. Also update proxy settings to use port 81:
```
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
```

4. After making either change, restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

5. Test the connection again:
```
curl http://localhost:81
```

The issue is that Bitnami's default configuration uses port 81 for HTTP instead of the standard port 80. This is common in some Bitnami configurations to avoid conflicts with other services.

Option 1 is generally preferred if you want your application to be accessible on the standard HTTP port (80).

---

_**User**_

Okay wait, please go slowly. I think my server.js is connected to port 80 is that right?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me clarify this:

1. Your Node.js application (server.js) is running on port 5501, as you confirmed with:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```
which returned your site content.

2. Apache is configured to listen on port 81, not the standard port 80.

3. Your goal is to set up Apache as a reverse proxy, so when people visit your domain (on port 80), Apache forwards the request to your Node.js app on port 5501.

The current issue is that Apache is not listening on port 80, which is the standard HTTP port. Instead, it's listening on port 81.

To fix this, we have a few options:

### Option 1: Update Apache to listen on port 80 instead of 81
This is the most straightforward solution for a standard setup. Change the Listen directive in httpd.conf.

### Option 2: Keep Apache on port 81 and set up port forwarding
Configure your Lightsail instance to forward external port 80 traffic to internal port 81.

### Option 3: Configure your Node.js app to listen on port 81 directly
This would avoid using Apache entirely.

Let's proceed with Option 1 as it's the most standard approach:

1. Edit the Apache configuration file:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf
```

2. Find the line that says:
```
Listen 81
```

3. Change it to:
```
Listen 80
```

4. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

5. Restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

6. Test if Apache is now listening on port 80:
```
curl http://localhost
```

This should now forward requests to your Node.js application on port 5501.

---

_**User**_

okay I want to do option 1

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's proceed with Option 1 - updating Apache to listen on port 80:

1. Edit the Apache configuration file:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf
```

2. Find the line that says:
```
Listen 81
```

3. Change it to:
```
Listen 80
```

4. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

5. Restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

6. Check if Apache is now listening on port 80:
```
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :80
```
You should see Apache (httpd) listening on port 80.

7. Test if you can connect to your site locally:
```
curl http://localhost
```
This should now return your site content.

8. If everything is working correctly, test your domain in a web browser.

If you encounter any issues, let me know and we'll troubleshoot them.

---

_**User**_

I see this:
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :80
tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      22219/httpd  

---

_**Assistant**_

Excellent! This shows that Apache is now successfully listening on port 80. The "httpd" process (PID 22219) is properly listening on all IPv6 interfaces (:::80).

Now let's test if the proxy is working:

```
curl http://localhost
```

This should now return the content from your Node.js application. If it works, it means Apache is successfully proxying requests from port 80 to your Node.js app on port 5501.

If that works, you're ready to test your domain in a web browser. Visit your domain (http://habscollection.com) and you should see your site.

If you're still having issues, check the Apache error logs:
```
sudo tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

Everything is looking good from here! Apache is listening on port 80 and should be proxying requests to your Node.js application on port 5501.

---

_**User**_

I see this but not my website content(check the screenshot):
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ curl http://localhost
<html><body><h1>HABS Collection</h1><p>Site is up and running!</p></body></html>


---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! Your domain is now working! The screenshot shows your website is successfully displaying with the "HABS Collection" header and "Site is up and running!" message, which matches exactly what you got from the curl command.

This confirms that:
1. Apache is correctly listening on port 80
2. The proxy is successfully forwarding requests to your Node.js application
3. Your domain (habscollection.com) is correctly pointing to your Lightsail instance
4. Your application is responding properly

You've successfully connected your domain to your Lightsail instance and set up the reverse proxy to your Node.js application!

Since this is just a simple "Site is up and running" page, that's what you're seeing. As you develop your application further, you'll see those changes reflected on your domain.

Congratulations! Your setup is working correctly. You can now continue building out your application, and all changes will be visible through your domain.

_**User**_

but my server should be connected to my github which has the full site 

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand - you need to connect your server to your GitHub repository to deploy the full site. Let's set that up:

1. First, let's check if Git is installed:
```
git --version
```

2. Navigate to your project directory:
```
cd /opt/habs-collection
```

3. Clone your GitHub repository (replace with your actual repository URL):
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git .
```
The trailing dot (.) tells Git to clone into the current directory.

If the directory is not empty, you may need to:
```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
git fetch
git pull origin main
```
(Use `main` or `master` depending on your branch name)

4. Install dependencies (if using Node.js):
```
npm install
```

5. Build your application if needed:
```
npm run build
```

6. Make sure your server.js is pointing to the correct files.
   - Check that the paths in your server.js match your cloned repository structure
   - If your GitHub repo has a different structure, you may need to update your server.js

7. Restart your Node.js application:
```
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```

8. Check if Apache is still working:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

9. Set up a webhook for automatic deployments (optional):
   - GitHub webhooks can trigger automatic pulls when you push to your repository
   - This requires additional setup with a webhook listener on your server

Let me know if you need help with any specific part of this process.

_**User**_

this is on http://localhost:5501/

---

_**Assistant**_

I see, so your Node.js application is correctly serving content on port 5501, but the proxy isn't showing the full website.

Let's check and fix the proxy configuration:

1. First, let's check your virtual host configuration to make sure it's correctly set up:
```
sudo cat /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```

Ensure it contains these lines:
```
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
```

2. Make sure the proxy modules are enabled:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl -M | grep proxy
```
You should see modules like `proxy_module` and `proxy_http_module` listed.

3. Let's check your Node.js server configuration:
```
cat scripts/server.js
```
Look for any routes or paths that might be limited or restricted.

4. Try making a request to a specific page to see if those are working:
```
curl http://localhost/index.html
```

5. Check Apache error logs for any clues:
```
sudo tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

6. It's possible your full site requires additional routes or resources. Try requesting other paths:
```
curl http://localhost/about
curl http://localhost/products
```
(Replace with actual routes from your application)

7. If you have static files (CSS, JS, images), check if those are being served:
```
curl http://localhost/assets/css/main.css
```
(Adjust the path based on your site structure)

The issue might be that Apache is correctly proxying the requests, but your Node.js application might be serving different content for different paths or might need additional configuration to serve your complete site.

---

_**User**_

This is what I see now

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. Your virtual host configuration is correct, and all the proxy modules are loaded. However, there's an error when you try to view the server.js file:

```
cat: scripts/server.js: No such file or directory
```

This suggests there might be a path issue. Let's figure out where your actual server.js file is located:

1. Find where your server.js file is:
```
find /opt -name "server.js"
```

2. Once you've found it, verify the correct path:
```
ls -la /path/to/directory/containing/server.js
```

3. Ensure your Node.js app is still running:
```
ps aux | grep node
```

4. Try to curl the application directly on port 5501 again:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```

5. Check what directories are in /opt/habs-collection:
```
ls -la /opt/habs-collection
```

The issue might be that your server.js path is different, or your server may have stopped running. If the server.js file has moved or the server has stopped, we need to locate the correct file and restart the application.

Let's also check the Node.js process:
```
ps aux | grep node
```
To see if it's still running and on what path.

_**Assistant**_

The 503 error indicates that Apache can't reach your Node.js application. Let's fix

---

_**User**_

Maybe my github is not connected?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right - it's likely that your GitHub repository is not connected to your server. The 503 error suggests that Apache is trying to proxy to your Node.js application, but it can't reach it or the application is not serving the content.

Let's go through the steps to properly connect your GitHub repository:

1. First, let's check if your Node.js app is still running:
```
ps aux | grep node
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd /opt/habs-collection
```

3. Clone your GitHub repository (replace with your actual repository URL):
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git temp
```

4. If the clone is successful, move files to the main directory:
```
mv temp/* .
mv temp/.* . 2>/dev/null
rmdir temp
```

5. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

6. Check if server.js exists in your repository:
```
ls -la scripts/server.js
```
If it doesn't exist in that path, find where it is:
```
find . -name "server.js"
```

7. Start your Node.js application from the correct directory:
```
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```
Adjust the path if needed based on where server.js is located.

8. Check if your application is running on port 5501:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```

9. Restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

10. Check your domain again in a browser.

If your GitHub repository has a different structure than what your server expects, you might need to adjust paths in your server.js file or in your Apache configuration.

_**User**_

I accidently did add my url, is this a problem or can I continue from here:bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git temp
Cloning into 'temp'...
Username for 'https://github.com': 

---

_**Assistant**_

No problem, you can just cancel the current git clone operation by pressing Ctrl+C, and then try again with your actual GitHub repository URL.

Let's start fresh with the proper URL:

1. Cancel the current operation with Ctrl+C

2. Clone your actual GitHub repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ACTUAL-USERNAME/YOUR-ACTUAL-REPO.git temp
```

Replace YOUR-ACTUAL-USERNAME with your GitHub username and YOUR-ACTUAL-REPO with your repository name.

For example, if your repository is at https://github.com/hafsayuusuf/habs-collection, you would use:
```
git clone https://github.com/hafsayuusuf/habs-collection.git temp
```

3. When prompted for a username and password, enter your GitHub credentials. If you use two-factor authentication, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password.

Then continue with the steps I outlined in my previous message to move the files, install dependencies, and restart your application.

_**User**_

What does the below mean?
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ ls -la scripts/server.js
-rw-r--r-- 1 bitnami bitnami 13641 Mar 25 15:11 scripts/server.js
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ 

---

_**Assistant**_

This output shows that the file `scripts/server.js` exists and is accessible. Let me explain what each part means:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 bitnami bitnami 13641 Mar 25 15:11 scripts/server.js
```

- `-rw-r--r--`: These are the file permissions. The owner (bitnami) can read and write the file, while group members and others can only read it.
- `1`: This is the number of hard links to the file.
- `bitnami bitnami`: The first "bitnami" is the owner of the file, and the second "bitnami" is the group owner.
- `13641`: This is the file size in bytes (about 13.3 KB).
- `Mar 25 15:11`: This is when the file was last modified (March 25th at 15:11).
- `scripts/server.js`: This is the path to the file.

This means your server.js file exists and is in the correct location that you've been referencing. It was last modified today, which suggests it's the file you've been working with.

If you're trying to connect your GitHub repository, you would still need to:

1. Clone your GitHub repository
2. Copy files from the cloned repository to your working directory
3. Reinstall dependencies if needed
4. Restart your Node.js application

Do you want to continue with connecting your GitHub repository, or are you having a different issue?

---

_**User**_

After running through the above steps I see this issue now, check attached image 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue now. You've successfully:

1. Cloned your GitHub repository
2. Run npm install
3. Both verified the scripts/server.js exists  

But now there's a key error:
```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 5501 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server
```

Your Node.js application isn't running on port 5501. Let's fix this:

1. Start your Node.js server:
```
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```

2. Check if it started successfully:
```
ps aux | grep node
```

3. Check the server logs for any errors:
```
cat server.log
```

4. If there are errors in starting the server, they might be related to:
   - Dependencies might not be properly installed
   - Environment variables might be missing
   - Database connections might be failing

5. Try starting the server in the foreground to see any immediate errors:
```
node scripts/server.js
```

The main issue is that your Node.js application isn't running. From the logs, you have the file, you've installed dependencies, but the server isn't starting or is crashing when it tries to start.

Let's get your Node.js application running first, then Apache should be able to proxy to it successfully.

_**User**_

Why am I still gettign the following:
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ cat server.log
Server running on port 5501

<html><body><h1>HABS Collection</h1><p>Site is up and running!</p></body></html>
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the confusion. Your Node.js server is running successfully on port 5501 and responding with the basic "HABS Collection" message, but it's not serving your full website content from GitHub.

The issue is likely related to how your server.js file is configured. Let's check a few things:

1. Examine your server.js file to see how it's set up to serve content:
```
head -50 scripts/server.js
```

2. Check if your server.js is configured to serve static files from your GitHub repository's structure:
```
grep -A 10 "static\|express.static" scripts/server.js
```

3. Look at what files are actually in your project directory:
```
ls -la
```

4. The server.js file might need to be updated to point to your actual content. Let's edit it:
```
nano scripts/server.js
```

Look for code that handles static file serving, like:
```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```
or
```javascript
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/../public'));
```

Make sure these paths match where your HTML/CSS/JS files are actually located.

5. Also check if there are specific routes defined that might need to be updated:
```
grep -A 5 "app.get\|router.get" scripts/server.js
```

6. If you find any paths that need to be updated, edit the file and save it.

7. After making changes, restart your Node.js server:
```
pkill -f node
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```

8. Test the connection again:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```

The issue is that your Node.js server is running, but it's not serving the full website content from your GitHub repository. We need to adjust the server code to properly serve those files.

---

_**User**_

I don;t have knowledge to this, please inspect

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue now. Looking at your server.js code, there are a few important things:

1. Your server is serving static files from a "../public" directory:
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../public')));
```

2. Your server is importing route files for cart, orders, and payment:
```javascript
const cartRoutes = require('../routes/cart');
const orderRoutes = require('../routes/orders');
const paymentRoutes = require('../routes/payment');
```

3. It's connecting these routes to API endpoints:
```javascript
app.use('/api/cart', cartRoutes);
app.use('/api/orders', orderRoutes);
app.use('/api/payments', paymentRoutes);
```

The main issue is that your actual HTML files (index.html, etc.) need to be in the correct location. Since your server is looking for files in the "../public" directory (relative to the script), you need to make sure your HTML files are there.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Check if the public directory exists:
```
ls -la ../public
```

2. If it doesn't exist, create it:
```
mkdir -p ../public
```

3. Move your HTML files to the public directory:
```
cp *.html ../public/
```

4. If you have other static assets (CSS, JS, images), move those too:
```
cp -r assets ../public/
cp -r css ../public/
cp -r js ../public/
```
(adjust the folders based on your actual structure)

5. Restart your Node.js server:
```
pkill -f node
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```

6. Test the connection again:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```

If your website has a more complex structure, you might need to adjust the directory structure to match what your server.js is expecting. The key is making sure your HTML and static files are in the "../public" directory relative to your scripts/server.js file.

---

_**User**_

I can't

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. You're getting permission errors when trying to create the "../public" directory:

```
mkdir: cannot create directory '../public': Permission denied
```

Let's fix this by using sudo and ensuring the directory is created with the correct permissions:

1. Create the public directory with sudo:
```
sudo mkdir -p ../public
```

2. Change the ownership of the directory to the bitnami user:
```
sudo chown bitnami:bitnami ../public
```

3. Move your HTML files to the public directory:
```
sudo cp *.html ../public/
```

4. If you have other static assets (CSS, JS, images), move those too:
```
sudo cp -r assets ../public/ 2>/dev/null
sudo cp -r css ../public/ 2>/dev/null
sudo cp -r js ../public/ 2>/dev/null
```

5. Make sure all files have the correct permissions:
```
sudo chmod -R 755 ../public
```

6. Restart your Node.js server:
```
pkill -f node
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```

7. Test the connection again:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```

This should resolve the permission issues and allow your server to serve the static files properly.

---

_**User**_

Can't I just do this through github 

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you can absolutely do this through GitHub! Instead of manually copying files, you can:

1. Update your server.js file to look for static files in the right location based on your GitHub repository structure

Here's how:

1. First, let's check your current GitHub repository structure:
```
ls -la
```

2. Edit your server.js file to point to where your HTML/CSS files actually are:
```
sudo nano scripts/server.js
```

3. Find the static file serving line:
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../public')));
```

4. Change

---

_**User**_

since I've already connected github 

---

_**Assistant**_

Since you've already connected your GitHub repository, let's adjust the server.js file to match your existing repository structure instead of trying to move files around.

1. First, let's check the root of your repository to see what files and directories are available:
```
ls -la
```

2. Edit your server.js file to point to the correct location:
```
sudo nano scripts/server.js
```

3. Look for the static file serving line:
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../public')));
```

4. Change this line to match where your HTML files actually are. For example, if your HTML files are in the root directory:
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..')));
```

Or if they're in a different directory like "assets", "dist", or "www":
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../assets')));
```

5. Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, then Ctrl+X)

6. Restart your Node.js application:
```
pkill -f node
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```

7. Test if it's working:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```

This approach adapts your server to work with your existing GitHub repository structure rather than trying to change the file structure to match the server's expectations.

---

_**User**_

Wait

---

_**Assistant**_

No problem, let's take a step back. What would you like to do next?

---

_**User**_

Should I be doing this when my website works fine on port 5501

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right - if your website works fine on port 5501, we're just missing the final piece to make it work through Apache on port 80.

Since you've confirmed:
1. Your Node.js app is running correctly on port 5501
2. You can access your site via `curl http://localhost:5501`
3. Apache is correctly configured to proxy to port 5501

The main issue might be with the Apache proxy configuration. Let's make sure it's properly set up:

1. Check your Apache virtual host configuration:
```
sudo cat /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```

2. Make sure it contains the ProxyPass directives pointing to port 5501:
```
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
```

3. Let's also check if there are any issues with Apache error logs:
```
sudo tail -100 /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
```

4. Try disabling and re-enabling the proxy modules:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

5. Test your domain in a web browser or with curl:
```
curl -v http://localhost
```

If your site works fine on port 5501 but not through Apache on port 80, the issue is likely in the Apache proxy configuration, not with your Node.js application itself.

---

_**User**_

What is this saying 

---

_**Assistant**_

The Apache error logs show several issues:

1. The key error is:
```
[Tue Mar 25 15:57:44.040232 2025] [proxy:error] [pid 26293:tid 26489] [client 127.0.0.1:55296] AH01114: HTTP: failed to make connection to backend: 127.0.0.1:5501
```

This indicates that Apache is trying to proxy requests to your Node.js application on port 5501, but it's failing to connect, even though your Node.js app seems to be running on that port.

2. You're also seeing authorization errors from clients trying to access phpunit:
```
[Tue Mar 25 15:39:13.830304 2025] [authz_core:error] [pid 24229:tid 24574] [client 117.50.223.105:44334] AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /opt/bitnami/magento/vendor/phpunit
```
These appear to be attempted exploits and aren't related to your main issue.

Let's fix the proxy connection issue:

1. First, verify your Node.js app is still running:
```
ps aux | grep node
```

2. Test if you can still access your app directly:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```

3. Check if there are any firewall rules blocking internal connections:
```
sudo iptables -L
```

4. Let's try restarting everything:
```
# Kill the Node.js process
pkill -f node

# Start it again
cd /opt/habs-collection
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &

# Verify it's running
curl http://localhost:5501

# Restart Apache
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart

# Test the proxy
curl http://localhost
```

5. We could also try changing the proxy configuration to use a different syntax:
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```

And modify the ProxyPass lines to:
```
ProxyRequests Off
SetEnv force-proxy-request-1.0 1
SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/ timeout=600
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5501/
```

Save, exit, and restart Apache again:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

The main issue is that Apache can't connect to your Node.js application even though it seems to be running and accessible directly.

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue now. You have two Node.js instances running:

1. One at `/opt/habs-collection/scripts/server.js` (PID 20833) - likely from earlier attempts
2. Another at `scripts/server.js` (PID 26945) - from your most recent start

This could be causing port conflicts. Let's fix this:

1. Kill all Node.js processes first:
```
pkill -f node
```

2. Start just one instance:
```
cd /opt/habs-collection
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```

3. Verify only one instance is running:
```
ps aux | grep node
```

4. Check that your app is accessible:
```
curl http://localhost:5501
```

5. Check your Apache configuration to ensure it's pointing to the right port:
```
sudo cat /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/habscollection.conf
```

6. Restart Apache:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/apachectl restart
```

7. Test the proxy:
```
curl http://localhost
```

Having multiple Node.js instances trying to bind to the same port (5501) would explain the connection failures in Apache logs. Let's clean this up and see if it resolves the issue.
