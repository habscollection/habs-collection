# Fixing Apache and Node.js Connection Issues (2025-03-25 16:16:58)

_**User**_

I have connected my domain on Lightsaill via apache and my domain works. But its not loading my full site which it should be connected via git. 

When I put localhost:5501 in a web browswer my full website code loads.

When I check curl:https://localhost:5501 it shows a simple html site is running page. Please can you help me fix this efficiently without wasting time. 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix your website connection issue. Based on the terminal, you have a Node.js server running on port 5501, but your Apache configuration might not be properly forwarding requests to this Node.js application.

Let's first look at the current directory structure and configuration files:

---



---

Now let's look at your Node.js server file:

---



---

Let's check the Apache configuration for your site:

---



---

_**User**_

Do I put this in the lightsail terminal?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, that's correct. You should run the Apache configuration check commands in your Lightsail terminal. From what I can see in the screenshot, you're already connected to your Lightsail instance via SSH.

Let's check your Apache configuration files to see how the virtual hosts are set up:

---



---

_**User**_

This happens

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue now. The Apache configuration directory doesn't exist where expected. This appears to be a Bitnami Magento setup, which has a different directory structure than standard Debian installations.

Let's check where Apache is installed on your Bitnami setup:

---



---

_**User**_

I get this:
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ find /opt/bitnami -name "httpd.conf" | cat
find: ‘/opt/bitnami/elasticsearch/config/jvm.options.d’: Permission denied
find: ‘/opt/bitnami/mariadb/plugin/auth_pam_tool_dir’: Permission denied
/opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf
/opt/bitnami/apache/conf/original/httpd.conf
/opt/bitnami/apache/conf/bitnami/httpd.conf
find: ‘/opt/bitnami/var/data’: Permission denied
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ 

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Now we know where the Apache configuration files are located. Let's check the virtual hosts configuration to see how to properly configure Apache to route to your Node.js application.

---



---

_**User**_

Nothing showed, please note I'm using the lightsail SSH terminal 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's look at the main Apache configuration file directly:

---



---

_**User**_

Inspect the screenshot first

---

_**Assistant**_

I see from the screenshot that you've tried to check for virtual hosts config and nothing showed up. Let's take a different approach. Let's look at the Bitnami Apache configuration files to find where virtual hosts are defined:

---



---

_**User**_

Okay check the screenshot

---

_**Assistant**_

I see now! The virtual hosts directory exists at `/opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/` and there's a `habscollection.conf` and `habscollection-vhost.conf` that appear to be your site's configuration files. Let's look at them:

---



---

_**User**_

Okay now we see this 

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! Now I can see the Apache configuration. I see that your website has a ProxyPass configuration set up to forward requests to a local Node.js server running on port 5501. Let's also check the vhost configuration file:

---



---

_**User**_

Please check now 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see both configuration files now. The issue is that your Apache server is trying to proxy requests to a local Node.js server running on port 5501 (using `ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5501/`), but there might be issues with how the Node.js application is set up.

Let's check if your Node.js server is running correctly:

---



---

_**User**_

Now check this, I'm not sure if this is my full file, as I have multiple pages via github

---

_**Assistant**_

I see your Node.js server is running (process ID 27513). Let's check the issue by examining your server.js file to understand how your routes are set up:

---



---

Let me try listing the directories first:

---



---

Sorry for the confusion. Let's list the files in the current directory:

---



---

_**User**_

Wait, I wil continue on lightsail 

---

_**Assistant**_

Understood. Please continue on your Lightsail terminal. To fix the issue, we need to:

1. Examine why your Node.js server on port 5501 isn't being properly proxied through Apache
2. Check the file paths and configurations to ensure everything is connected correctly

When you're ready in your Lightsail terminal, we should examine:

1. Your Node.js server.js file: `cat /opt/habs-collection/scripts/server.js`
2. Check if the Node.js server is binding to the correct interface: It should be listening on 0.0.0.0:5501 instead of just localhost:5501 to be accessible through the proxy
3. Verify the Apache proxy settings are correct
4. Check Apache error logs for any issues: `cat /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log`

Let me know when you're ready to continue on Lightsail, and we'll fix this issue.

---

_**User**_

Please note, I have my full website on github and I have a scripts folder with JS files, but I also have HTML files, plus I have a .env file. Here is my full website. I just need lightsail or Apache to pull the content via my gitub 

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand now. You need to deploy your GitHub repository content to your Lightsail instance. Here's how to fix this:

1. First, let's clone your GitHub repository to your Lightsail instance:

---



---

_**User**_

I recieved this:
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ cd /opt && sudo git clone https://github.com/habscollection/habs-collection.git
fatal: destination path 'habs-collection' already exists and is not an empty directory.
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt$ 


---

_**Assistant**_

The repository already exists at `/opt/habs-collection/`. Let's update it by pulling the latest changes:

---



---

_**User**_

I see this now:
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt$ cd /opt/habs-collection && sudo git pull
Already up to date.
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ 

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Your repository is up to date. Now let's check your Node.js server to make sure it's properly configured to serve your website:

---



---

_**User**_

I see this now:
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ cat /opt/habs-collection/scripts/server.js | head -20
require('dotenv').config();
const express = require('express');
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Product = require('../models/Product');
const Order = require('../models/Order');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
const path = require('path');
const session = require('express-session');
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');
const app = express();

// Connect to MongoDB
async function connectDB() {
    try {
        await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
            useNewUrlParser: true,
            useUnifiedTopology: true
        });
        console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's check how your server is listening to requests. We need to know if it's binding to the correct address:

---



---

_**User**_

This is what I see now:
bitnami@ip-172-26-4-48:/opt/habs-collection$ cat /opt/habs-collection/scripts/server.js | grep -A 10 "app.listen" | cat
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));

---

_**Assistant**_

Now we need to check how PORT is defined in your server.js file:

---



---

It looks like there's an issue when trying to execute commands on your local machine. Let's continue with the Lightsail terminal. Here's the issue and solution:

1. Your Node.js application is listening on a PORT defined in the server.js file, but Apache is configured to proxy to port 5501.

2. We need to do two things:
   - Modify the server.js file to explicitly listen on 0.0.0.0:5501
   - Make sure your application can serve static files properly

Let's modify your server.js file:

---



---

_**User**_

I've done the above and received this

---

_**Assistant**_

I see you're editing the server.js file in the nano editor. Now, we need to scroll down to find where the server is listening for connections. 

Use the nano editor to:
1. Press Ctrl+W to search
2. Type "app.listen" and press Enter
3. Find the line where your server is setting the PORT and listening

Then, we need to modify it to explicitly listen on port 5501 and bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0). 

Look for something like:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

And change it to:
```javascript
const PORT = 5501;
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

Use your arrow keys to navigate to that part of the file, make the changes, and then press Ctrl+O to save and Ctrl+X to exit.

---

_**User**_

it is listening to 5501, the problem is not my code 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue now. Your code is correctly set to listen on port 5501, but it's not binding to all interfaces. It needs to be modified to bind to 0.0.0.0 instead of just localhost.

Change this line:
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

To this:
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT} (all interfaces)`));
```

This will allow your Node.js server to accept connections from outside localhost, which is necessary for Apache's reverse proxy to work properly.

Also, I noticed that your application serves files from '../public', but I need to check if this directory exists and has your content:

---



---

_**User**_

my files are in the main branch on git, I don't think its on public

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right. I noticed in your server.js, it's looking for files in the '../public' directory, but your website files are in the main branch without a 'public' directory. This is likely causing the issue.

Let's modify your server's static file configuration to serve files from the root directory instead of a 'public' directory that doesn't exist:

1. In the nano editor, find the line where you set up the static file middleware:

Look for something like:
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../public')));
```

Change it to:
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..')));
```

This will tell Express to serve static files from the root of your repository (one level up from the scripts directory where server.js is located), which is where your HTML files are.

Also, find the line for the catch-all route:
```javascript
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../public', 'index.html'));
});
```

And change it to:
```javascript
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'index.html'));
});
```

After making these changes, save the file (Ctrl+O, then Enter), and exit (Ctrl+X). Then restart your Node.js server:

---



---

_**User**_

Please explain why I should do the above if my website is running on localhost:5501 and I want to connect it to my domain via lightsail?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me clarify what's happening and why these changes are needed:

1. Your Node.js application is correctly running on port 5501, but there's a disconnect between how Apache proxy is configured and how your application is serving files.

2. Currently, your application is trying to serve files from a '/public' directory (based on the server.js code), but your actual HTML/CSS/JS files are in the root of your repository.

3. When someone visits your domain, Apache is proxying requests to localhost:5501, but your Node.js application can't find the files to serve because it's looking in the wrong directory.

4. The changes I suggested will correct the path so your Node.js application can find and serve your HTML/CSS/JS files that are in the root of your repository.

5. Additionally, making sure your application listens on '0.0.0.0' instead of just localhost ensures it can accept connections from Apache's proxy.

In simpler terms: Your website files exist and your server is running, but your server is looking for files in a directory that doesn't exist. The changes will tell your server where your files actually are.

Would you like to make these changes to fix the issue?

---

_**User**_

it can't find node-app

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand, let's simplify. Since there's no systemd service for node-app, let's restart your Node.js server manually:

---



---

_**User**_

it doesn't work that way

---

there was a different way I was calling my server

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right. Looking at your earlier terminal output, I can see you were running your server using:

```
node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```

Let's restart it the same way after making the necessary changes:

1. First, let's make sure we save the changes to your server.js file in the nano editor. Press Ctrl+O, then Enter to save, and Ctrl+X to exit.

2. Then, let's find and stop your current Node.js process:

---



---

_**User**_

Done, see screenshot,

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see you're in the editor. The most critical issue is that your code in the "Serve SPA for all other routes" section is looking for files in '../public' directory, but your files are in the root directory.

Let's make these two important changes:

1. First, change this line:
```javascript
res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../public', 'index.html'));
```

To:
```javascript
res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'index.html'));
```

2. Second, modify the app.listen line to bind to all interfaces:
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

After making these changes:
1. Press Ctrl+O to save
2. Press Enter to confirm
3. Press Ctrl+X to exit

Then restart your Node.js server with:

---



---

_**User**_

That was the wrong screenshot, check now 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the updated screenshot. I notice:

1. There's no systemd service for Node.js (both attempts to restart using systemctl failed)
2. You've successfully started your Node.js server with `nohup node scripts/server.js > server.log 2>&1 &`
3. Your server is now running with PID 29174

Let's check if your server is responding correctly now:

---



---

_**User**_

Its still not

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's check your server logs to see why it's not responding:

---



---

_**User**_

Nothing shows 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. Your curl test shows that your Node.js server is returning the "Site is up and running!" message for localhost:5501, but it's not serving your actual website files.

Let's try a more direct approach to solve this issue:

1. First, let's check what express.static is configured for:

---



---

_**User**_

I see the following now

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! I can see that your server is configured with:

```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..')));
```

This is correct and should serve files from the root of your repository. Now let's check where your catch-all route is sending files from:

---



---

_**User**_

I see the following:

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! Now I can see more of your server configuration. I found the critical section:

```javascript
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'index.html'));
});
```

Both your static file serving and catch-all route look good. They are correctly configured to look in the root directory (`..`) relative to the scripts folder.

Now let's check two more things:

1. Let's make sure your Node.js server is listening on 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) and not just localhost:

---



---

_**User**_

See here 

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! I found the issue. Your server is already configured to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0):

```javascript
app.listen(PORT, 0.0.0.0 => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

Let's restart your Node.js server to make sure it's using the latest configuration:

---



---

_**User**_

See here 

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! I see your server has been restarted with PID 29407.

Now let's check if your index.html file exists in the root directory:

---



---

_**User**_

See here 

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! I can see that your index.html file exists at `/opt/habs-collection/index.html`.

Now let's check if Apache is correctly forwarding requests to your Node.js server:

---



---

_**User**_

are you sure its my index.html as there is already another index.html connected to the current domain

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right to question this. Let's check the content of the index.html to make sure it's your actual website:

---



---

_**User**_

Okay it does look like my website

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! That is definitely your Habs Collection website. Now let's check a few more things to figure out why Apache isn't serving your Node.js application properly.

Let's check the Apache error logs:

---



---

_**User**_

I see this now

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's check if the ProxyPass directive in your Apache configuration is correctly set up:

---



---

_**User**_

Wait check the error logs 

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the error logs, I see a few interesting things:

1. The Apache server is properly running and responding to HTTP requests
2. There are some "invalid URI path" errors from clients trying to access unusual paths
3. The response headers for localhost show `X-Powered-By: Express`, which means Express.js is correctly handling requests

Let's check if your domain is properly pointed to your server by testing it:

---



---

_**User**_

Which clients? See here 

---

_**Assistant**_

Now I found the real issue! In the error logs, I see:

```
[Tue Mar 25 15:57:44.204232 2025] [proxy:error] [pid 26293:tid 26489] (111)Connection refused: AH00957: http: attempt to connect to 127.0.0.1:5501 (127.0.0.1:5501) failed

[Tue Mar 25 16:04:43.827309 2025] [proxy:error] [pid 26299:tid 26621] (111)Connection refused: AH00957: http: attempt to connect to 127.0.0.1:5501 (127.0.0.1:5501) failed
```

These errors clearly show that Apache is correctly trying to proxy requests to your Node.js server at 127.0.0.1:5501, but the connection is being refused.

Also, when checking your domain directly:
```
X-Powered-By: Express
```

This is interesting - Express is responding, but not with your full site.

The issue is that while your server starts up, it has problems fully loading, likely due to the database connection. Let's check your MongoDB connection:

---



---

_**User**_

nothing is showing 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's try looking at your server logs directly:

---



---

_**User**_

I see the following

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah! Found the issue. There's a syntax error in your server.js file:

```
SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
  at wrapSafe (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1472:18)
  at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1501:20)
```

The issue is on line 372 of server.js:

```javascript
app.listen(PORT,0.0.0.0 => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

There's a syntax error in how you're defining the IP address to listen on. Let's fix this by editing the server.js file:

---



---

_**User**_

okay

---

_**Assistant**_

When you open the file in nano, navigate to line 372 (the `app.listen` line) and modify it to:

```javascript
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

The correct syntax requires:
1. The port number (PORT)
2. The host to listen on ('0.0.0.0' in quotes)
3. The callback function (() => {...})

After editing, save the file (Ctrl+O, then Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X).

Then restart your Node.js server:

---



---

_**User**_

Could you provide the correct syntax

---

_**Assistant**_

Here's the correct syntax for the `app.listen` line:

```javascript
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

The current syntax:
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, 0.0.0.0 => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

Has two issues:
1. The IP address `0.0.0.0` should be a string in quotes: `'0.0.0.0'`
2. The arrow function is missing parentheses: should be `() =>` instead of `0.0.0.0 =>`

When using nano to edit the file, use the arrow keys to navigate to that line, make the changes, then press Ctrl+O to save and Ctrl+X to exit.

---

_**User**_

okay I've done that

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Now restart your Node.js server to apply the changes:

---



---

_**User**_

I've done that 

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Let's check if your Node.js server is running properly now:

---



---

_**User**_

What does this mean 

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! I can see your server.js code has been properly edited. The line now shows:

```javascript
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

And your Node.js process is running with PID 29646.

Now let's check if the server is properly responding:

---



---

_**User**_

Its still showing another HTML FILE! 

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right! Your Node.js server is running but still only showing the basic "Site is up and running!" HTML instead of your full website.

There's one more thing to check. Your server.js needs to properly serve static files from the correct location. Let's check how your static file middleware is configured:

---



---

_**User**_

We did that already, why is it showing a HTML that does not belong to my website?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right, and I apologize for the confusion. It seems there's a custom route handling in your server.js file that's overriding the static file serving and sending a simple "Site is up and running!" message.

Let's find and modify that route:

---



---

_**User**_

See outcome here for experss. See here 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue now. Let's find all routes that might be returning this "Site is up and running" message:

---



---

_**User**_

Nothing is returning from teh above request

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's try to search for any specific route that might be overriding your static file serving:

---



---

_**User**_

See below, inspect properly 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue now! In your server.js, there's a route that's handling all requests (the catch-all route) at line 361-363:

```javascript
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'index.html'));
});
```

This route is correctly sending the index.html file, but something is still causing the simplified "Site is up and running" message to be shown. Let's check if there are any conflicting routes or middleware that might be causing this:

---



---

_**User**_

That command does not provide anything

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's try looking for other routes or handlers that might be interfering:

---



---

_**User**_

I see this now 

---

grep -A 10 "Site is up and running" /opt/habs-collection/scripts/server.js | cat = this command does not show any response 

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand now. There's no specific line in your server.js that has "Site is up and running" text. This message is being generated dynamically, likely as a simple response from Express when it's not finding the proper files to serve.

Let's try a new approach by examining your index.html file directly:

---



---

_**User**_

Check outcome 

---

this doesn't look like my full site as well

---

_**Assistant**_

I see what's happening now. Your index.html file is correct, but it seems the CSS and other assets might not be loading correctly. This suggests the issue is with how the static files are being served.

Let's check if the CSS files and other assets exist and are accessible:

---



---

_**User**_

All CSS is there 

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right, all the CSS files are there. Let's check the Apache access logs to see if there are requests for those CSS files but they're returning errors:

---



---

_**User**_

Check here 

---

Please think with full context and understanding 

---

_**Assistant**_
